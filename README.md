# Machine Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository!  
I am currently learning the fascinating field of **Machine Learning**, exploring its concepts and building my skills step by step. 
This repository serves as a log of my journey, where I document my understanding, projects, and learning milestones.

## 📚 Current Learning Status  
I am still in the learning phase and have started with the basics of Machine Learning. So far, I have completed:  
- **Linear Regression/Gradient**: Understanding how this fundamental algorithm works, its applications, and how to implement it from scratch and using libraries like `sklearn`.

## 📈 Topics to Learn (Upcoming)  
Here’s a list of topics I plan to explore:  
1. **Supervised Learning**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Trees  
   - Random Forests  
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
2. **Unsupervised Learning**  
   - Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical)  
   - Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE)  
3. **Neural Networks**  
   - Basics of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)  
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  
   - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)  
4. **Reinforcement Learning**  
5. **Feature Engineering**  
6. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - RMSE, R-squared, F1-Score, Precision-Recall, etc.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries  
Here are the tools and libraries I am using or plan to use:  
- **Python** as the primary programming language.  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (for data manipulation and visualization).  
  - `scikit-learn` (for implementing Machine Learning models).  
  - `tensorflow`, `keras`, `pytorch` (future goals for deep learning).

## 🎯 Goals  
- Gain a solid understanding of the fundamentals of Machine Learning.  
- Build projects to apply and reinforce what I learn.  
- Contribute to open-source Machine Learning repositories in the future.
